The main function is in version2.py and parsing helper functions are in parser_1.py. We parse the structure of the neural network and then reconstruct the model. We calculate the features, such as flops and order of layers, of these models. Then we use xbgboosting model to fit the data by different weight. We tune the paramters using GridSearchCV.
